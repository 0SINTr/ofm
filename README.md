**Important!**
This methodology refers to passive, non-intrusive OSINT tasks.
The mentioned tools are just examples, not an exhaustive list.
The OFM methodology only addresses the Data Collection phase.
The OFM best fits OSINT investigations related to individuals.

## Goal
The main goal of OFM is to provide a clear path for performing the **Data Collection** phase of an OSINT investigation, so that enough and diverse data can be passed further to the **Data Process & Analysis** phases.\
With hundreds of websites, services and CLI tools available, conducting a coherent research may be overwhelming. For this reason, the OSINT-er should have a clear, easy-to-follow plan for collecting data in an organized manner.

## Steps
OFM is meant to be followed in a top-down approach.

### Search engines
- This step may sometimes collect the most amount of data, although this data may be quite scattered and raw in the absence of any kind of automation.
- The tools used in this step are the most well-known search engines such as Google, Bing, Yandex, Yahoo and DuckDuckGo.
- For each engine, advanced search and scrape methods can be applied to filter the results via built-in operators or patterns.
