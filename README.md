**OSINT Funnel Methodology** for creating a coherent data collection workflow in investigations.

**Important!**
This methodology refers to passive, non-intrusive OSINT tasks.
The mentioned tools are just examples, not an exhaustive list.
The OFM methodology only addresses the Data Collection phase.
The OFM best fits OSINT investigations related to individuals.

## Goal
The main goal of OFM is to provide a clear path for performing the **Data Collection** phase of an OSINT investigation, so that enough and diverse data can be passed further to the **Data Process & Analysis** phases.\
With hundreds of websites, services and CLI tools available, conducting a coherent research may be overwhelming. For this reason, the OSINT-er should have a clear, easy-to-follow plan for collecting data in an organized manner.

## Steps
**OFM is meant to be followed in a top-down approach.**

### Search engines
- This step may sometimes collect the most amount of data, although this data may be quite scattered and raw in the absence of any kind of automation.
- The tools used in this step are the most well-known search engines such as Google, Bing, Yandex, Yahoo and DuckDuckGo.
- For each engine, advanced search and scrape methods can be applied to filter the results via built-in operators or patterns.

### Specialized tools
- After the first wave of (more or less) relevant data has been collected and filtered from search engines, the next step is to use specialized OSINT tools on the most relevant bits of data that are available regarding the target (usernames, email addresses, phone numbers, names or nicknames etc.).
- These tool are meant to further filter and narrow the search, however they can also provide new insights and leads on the target's online presence. Combining these tool with the advanced searches from the previous step may already build a significant portion of the target's digital footprint.

### Social avenues
- The information collected in the previous two steps may point to one or more social media profiles that the target is using. These profiles may include, but not be limited to, well-known social media services - Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, X or Reddit, secondary or emerging social networks such as Bluesky or Truth Social, blogs, forums, or chat rooms such as Telegram, Discord etc.
- Any of these avenues can lead to discovering more information about the target, either personal (age, birthday, photos, locations) or ideological / ethical such as political, cultural, religious or sexual preferences, among others. Any such lead can further unravel a suite of pathways to explore, and can also help paint a better picture of the target.
